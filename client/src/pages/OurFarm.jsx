							Our Farm Story
						</h2>

						<p className=' text-white text-xl text-start mb-6'>
							When we retired from busy careers in medicine in 2015, it was a
							wonderful opportunity to pursue a lifelong dream of full-time
							farming. Both of us are inveterate gardeners and looked forward to
							the less stressful life on a small farm in the country.
						</p>

						<p className='text-white text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6'>
							The idea of operating a commercial sized orchard and integrated
							farm evolved gradually, starting with a few apple trees expanding
							to three orchards with over 100 apple and pear trees, and a
							one-acre blueberry orchard.
						</p>

						<p className='text-white text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6'>
							Along with a love of growing things, we both have an abiding love
							and respect for animals. We started with a small flock of chickens
							which grew to over eighty hens and a small commercial egg
							business. In 2021 we added Nigerian Dwarf dairy goats with two
							bucks and two does, with plans to grow the herd gradually over
							several years.
						</p>

						<p className='text-white text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6'>
							Farming hasn't turned out to be quite as stress free as we had
							naively hoped. There are certainly challenges, especially for
							novice farmers. We anticipated surprises from weather and the many
							unknowns of the land itself, but there were some things we hadn't
							even considered.

							The deer in the photo at the bottom of the page are beautiful,
							frequent visitors on our farm, but when they chewed all the
							branches from our two-year-old apple trees, we had to add the wire
							cages to keep them off. A year or two later, when the trees were
							large enough to survive the deer browsing, and finally produce
							their first crop, bears broke several large branches to get the
							few half-ripe apples. Because they had no respect whatsoever for
							the wire cages, we installed an electric fence around the orchard.
							That worked well until a storm blew a tree down across the
							fence-line and flattened a whole row of fence. Any farmer knows
							that stories like this are common and just part of the business.
							It's been a wild, fascinating learning experience, which is part
							of the fun!
						</p>

						<p className='text-white text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6'>
							With all the challenges of farming in general, we frequently ask
							ourselves, "why add the complication of growing organic?" The
							answer isn't always easy to put into words. We believe that
							organic agricultural practices produce healthier, more nutritious
							food, and are better for people and the environment. We also like
							the idea of building healthy soil to produce healthy plants. That
							healthy soil will be part of our legacy to future generations.
							Agricultural land is disappearing at an alarming rate in America.
							What remains is rapidly becoming eroded by petrochemical
							industrial agricultural practices. It took eons to build that
							soil, it won't come back overnight, at least not without some
							help.
						</p>

						<p className=' text-white text-xl'>
							Despite all the challenges, or maybe because of them, we both love
							the opportunity to grow and raise healthy, chemical-free food for
							the local market and do our part to support a healthy ecosystem.
							We also thoroughly enjoy the chance to meet folks of like mind who
							appreciate the value of locally grown food and organic
							agriculture.
